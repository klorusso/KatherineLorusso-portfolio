![ ](images/IMG_8749.JPG){width=400px}

My name is **Katherine Lorusso**, and I am a first year **Master of Public Health** student in **Epidemiology**. 
I receieved my **Bachelor of Science in Public Health** from the **University of Mississippi** in May 2025.  

### Research Interests
At the University of Mississippi, I contributed to a geospatial research project examining how **accessibility and safety within the built environment relates to Diabetes prevalence across the Deep South**.

I am particularly interested in **infectious disease outbreaks and survellience**. 

### Data Analysis Experience 
Last semester, I took *EPID 7500: Intro Coding with R for Public Health* with Dr. Winter, so I am familar with R. I am excited to apply the skills I gained in that course and continue to build upon them, while also learning to use other platforms. 

### Goal for MADA 
My main goal for this course is to gain **confidence in data analysis**. Although I have some prior experience, I want to sharpen all the skills I have learned to feel more comfortable and confident analyzing data and working on projects.  

### Data Analysis Website 
While at the University of Mississippi, I worked frequently on [PolicyMap](https://www.policymap.com/), which is an **interactive data visualization website** used to analyze community data related to demographics, health conditions, insurance coverage, and more. My favorite part about this platform is how interactive it. Users can *explore different types of data, hover over  counties to compare them, and download the datasets for further analysis*. 

### Fun Facts!
* I'm from **New Orleans, Louisiana**
* I have *slightly* different colored eyes (one darker brown, one lighter brown)
* My family rescued a black lab mix from Lake Oconee
